# Find a path with 5 "hops" (edge) using the full Marvel dataset.
# This test exercises both the parser and BFS algorithm on a rather large
# graph, so it is more of a system test than a true unit test. Such tests
# should only be run after you have tested the parser and BFS algorithm
# separately on much smaller graphs.

# To run this test, the marvel dataset must exist at
# hw-marvel/src/main/resources/data/marvel.tsv
