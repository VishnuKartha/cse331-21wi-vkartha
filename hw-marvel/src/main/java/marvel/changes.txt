Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel, and why you made those changes.


I changed the rep invariant and checkRep() function accordingly
to also include that the nodes are not null,
that none of the sets of edges are null, and that none of the edges inside those sets are null.
Additionally, each edge's parent and child should be nodes inside the graph. I changed this
based on the feedback from hw5 - p2.

I changed the debug flag to be static and final.I changed this based on the feedback from hw5 - p2.

I added more description to the abstraction function stating how the adjacency list represents
the abstract graph. I changed this based on the feedback from hw5 - p2.

I added a containsEdge(Edge e) and containsNode(Node n) method so that
it easy to check if a new Node or Edge is unique.

I changed the location of the debug flag in my code to be inside of the checkRep() function
so that only the expensive checks are bypassed, the simple checks are not.
I changed this based on the feedback from hw5 - p2.


I changed the description of addEdge(Edge e) in order to specify that if either node in the given
edge is not in the graph, it adds the node to the graph.I changed this
based on the feedback from hw5 - p2.

I changed the description of getOutgoingEdges(Node parentNode) in order to
specify that it requires parentNode != null. I changed this
based on the feedback from hw5 - p2.
