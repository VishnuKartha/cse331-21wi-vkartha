# Creates a single graph and adds 2 nodes(n1,n2) to it and an edge from n1 to n2.
# Then lists the children of of n1 in graph1 and n2 in graph1(no children for n2)

# Create a Graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge between the two nodes
added edge 10.000 from n1 to n2 in graph1

#List the children of n1 and n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(10.0)
the children of n2 in graph1 are:
