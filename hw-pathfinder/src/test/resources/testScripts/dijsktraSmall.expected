# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm with a small graph

created graph smallGraph

added node A to smallGraph
added node B to smallGraph
added node C to smallGraph


added edge 2.000 from A to B in smallGraph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in smallGraph
added edge 10.000 from A to C in smallGraph



path from A to C:
A to B with weight 2.000
B to C with weight 1.000
total cost: 3.000
