# tests if the uniqueness of edges is too strong
# Tests that you can add two edges with the same parent and child if they have different labels
# Then tests that you can add two edges with the same label if it has a different parent or child.

# Create a Graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Adds 4 edges
added edge 1.000 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge 2.000 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge 2.000 from n2 to n1 in graph1
added edge 1.000 from n2 to n1 in graph1
