# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm with a small graph

created graph smallGraph

added node A to smallGraph
added node B to smallGraph



added edge 2.000 from A to B in smallGraph
added edge 10000000.000 from B to A in smallGraph





path from A to B:
A to B with weight 2.000
total cost: 2.000
