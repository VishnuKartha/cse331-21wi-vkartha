# Create a Graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1

# Adds 4 edges
added edge 3.000 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge 4.000 from n1 to n4 in graph1
added edge 2.000 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge 1.000 from n1 to n2 in graph1

#Lists the children
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(1.0) n2(2.0) n3(3.0) n4(4.0)
