# listing the children of two different graphs

# Create a Graph
created graph graph1
created graph graph2

# Add a pair of nodes
added node A to graph1
added node B to graph1
added node C to graph2
added node D to graph2

# Adds 2 edges
added edge e1 from A to B in graph1
added edge e2 from C to D in graph2

# list the children of both graphs
the children of A in graph1 are: B(e1)
the children of C in graph2 are: D(e2)
