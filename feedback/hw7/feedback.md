#### Overall Feedback

Excelllent work on this assignment! There are a couple of small things below, but you really did some great work!

#### More Details
- for your Djisktra's method, you should probably specify that it is the shortest path by edge weight (not fewest number of edges)
- you probably want to make your graph building process a static method somewhere so that JUnit tests are able to test it (as it is a complicated operation that we ought to test).
